        <h1>Travel to Kazakhstan</h1>
        <h2>Kazakhstan - The Land of Wonders</h2>
        <p>Kazakhstan is a unique region in the world because of its history, geographical position, and size. Being the world’s 9th largest country and located in the centre of Eurasia, it is also the largest landlocked country in the world. These factors have resulted in the country's particular climate and nature, which seem to absorb the brightest examples of the landscape of both continents. In addition, the complicated history of the Kazakh people and the constant interaction of nomadic lifestyle with settled people in South Kazakhstani ancient cities have led to Kazakhstan's unique and authentic culture.</p>

        <h2>Nature-based tourism</h2>
        <p>The diversity of Kazakhstan's natural areas has contributed to its rich flora and fauna. The country is a habitat for about 122 mammal species, 500 bird species, and 107 fish species; in addition, over six thousand species of plants grow in the region. In order to preserve such a rich world of plants and wildlife, a network of national parks and nature reserves was established in the country. Recently, these protected areas have become accessible to visitors.</p>

        <h2>Mountains: Trekking and winter sports</h2>
        <p>A series of mountain ranges of various sizes – such as the Tien Shan, Altay, Ulytau, and Kazygurt – are naturally beautiful and attract tourists from all over the world. The Tien Shan Mountains are the highest among them (with the highest peak being about 7,500 metres [24,500 feet]), and Almaty, the largest city of Kazakhstan, is located at its base. Thus, tourists interested in trekking and winter sports can easily access marvelous landscapes directly from the city of Almaty.</p>
